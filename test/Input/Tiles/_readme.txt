It is a 100 (10x10) tile montage cut from a larger monolithic image.  Each tile is 1024 x 1024.  The tiles have 50% overlap (ie the cutting template was shifted 512 pixels between tiles).  Additionally, I added some 'slop' to the shifts to simulate montage artifacts.  I have two files that can accompany the tiles.  The first is the intended locations of the 100 tiles (ie perfect stage movement) and the second is the actual location.
TileConfiguration3D is a 169 (13 x 13) tile montage of 320 x 320 x 150 images with an overlap of 40 pixels between tiles. 
TileConfiguration3D.registered is the actual registered location of the 3D blocks.
